# rime-nihongo-hybrid
A Japanese input schema for [RIME](http://rime.im/), converted from [mozc](https://github.com/google/mozc)'s dictionary. See https://github.com/google/mozc/blob/master/src/data/dictionary_oss/README.txt for license.

Usage: copy everything in `dist/` into RIME's user directory, and they should be ready for deployment. Deployment methods and the location of user directory are platform dependent. See RIME's [CustomizationGuide](https://github.com/rime/home/wiki/CustomizationGuide) for more information.

Currently only supports Hepburn-like romanization. Could be buggy; use at your own risk.
