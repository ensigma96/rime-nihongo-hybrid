# rime-nihongo-hybrid
A Japanese input schema for [RIME](http://rime.im/), converted from [mozc](https://github.com/google/mozc)'s dictionary. See https://github.com/google/mozc/blob/master/src/data/dictionary_oss/README.txt for license.

Currently only supports Hepburn-like romanization. Could be buggy; use at your own risk.
